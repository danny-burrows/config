# config
My config for tmux and nvim.

## External Programs
Some programs that are either required or enhance the config.

### Required
- xclip - Needed to ensure tmux can copy on drag!
- [rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer)
- [Bash LSP](https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server)

### Recommended
- fd (Telescope)
- ripgrep (Telescope livegrep)
- shellcheck (Bash linting)

Note: ripgrep and fd should be installed with cargo to work properly with the nvim config.
